## Description:
As California lifts its stay-at-home order, we wanted to provide a resource that allows a person to view the safety measurements of a business/venue before visiting. Therefore, we created the 'Covid Venue Tracker' which allows the community to post/comment about the safety measures of a business regarding their most recent visit. 

## Installation:
* inquirer
* npm run watch

## Usage:  
[Website] After signing up or logging in, the application naviages the user to the dashboard where they could post an entry about a new business or search exisiting businesses based on zipcode. Once businesses have been added, the user is able to search each business by zipcode in the search bar. The search bar then provides a page with all the results regardin the chosen zipcode. It displays a list of businesses and a form rating their safety guidelines.
